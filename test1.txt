Super Bowl LX was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2025 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Seattle Seahawks defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion New England Patriots 29–13. The game took place on February 8, 2026, at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the second Super Bowl to be held in the stadium and the third to be in the San Francisco Bay Area.
The Seahawks' victory was their second and first since 2013's Super Bowl XLVIII during their Legion of Boom era. Finishing the season with a 14–3 record and the NFC's top seed, they were making their fourth appearance. The Patriots, who finished with a 14–3 record and the AFC's second seed, extended their record of appearances to 12. They were seeking a record seventh title since the Brady–Belichick era after last winning 2018's Super Bowl LIII. The two franchises previously met in Super Bowl XLIX, which was won by the Patriots.
The game was largely a defensive battle until the fourth quarter saw the first offensive scoring with touchdowns. This was the fifth Super Bowl to not have a touchdown in the first half of the game and the second to not have a touchdown scored in the first three quarters. Running back Kenneth Walker III was named Super Bowl MVP and was the first running back to win the award since Terrell Davis in 1997's Super Bowl XXXII.
The game was broadcast on NBC in addition to streaming on NBCUniversal's Peacock. Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny served as the entertainment for the Super Bowl LX Halftime Show, which also featured Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin.

Background
Host selection
Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, the venue of the game
The NFL has made all decisions regarding hosting sites since organizing the Super Bowl LVII, at which point they removed the bidding process. The new process meant that potential hosts would put together a proposal, with the league owners then voting to determine viability.
On May 22, 2023, the league announced that Super Bowl LX would be played at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, home of the San Francisco 49ers. This is the third Super Bowl in the San Francisco Bay Area and second at Levi's Stadium. Super Bowl XIX, played at Stanford Stadium in 1985, was won by San Francisco 49ers over the Miami Dolphins. More recently, Super Bowl 50, played at Levi's Stadium in 2016, featured the Denver Broncos defeating the Carolina Panthers.

As has been a tradition since Super Bowl LVI, the logo includes Roman numerals featuring imagery from the host city/region. For Super Bowl LX, the logo was revealed on February 9, 2025, in a social media post by game broadcaster NBC Sports following the conclusion of Super Bowl LIX, ahead of a formal unveiling at a post-game press conference in New Orleans the next day. The Roman numerals have a CMYK theme, incorporating Bay Area landmarks such as the San Francisco skyline, the Golden Gate Bridge, and redwood trees.
Super Bowl week events
The Super Bowl Experience was hosted at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
In October 2025, it was announced that the 2026 Pro Bowl Games would be held on the Tuesday prior to the Super Bowl, February 3, at the Moscone Center, downsizing the event and integrating it into the Super Bowl's festivities.

Game summary
First half
Seahawks kicker Jason Myers scored a Super Bowl record five field goals.
The Patriots won the coin toss and chose to defer their choice to the second half; Seattle chose to take the ball. The game began with a kickoff by Patriots kicker Andrés Borregales, and while the Seahawks drove down the field inside the Patriots' 20-yard line, including a 23-yard pass to Cooper Kupp, they failed to score in the red zone. With their first possession, the Seahawks scored a 33-yard field goal. The Patriots then began their first drive on the 28-yard line after running back D'Ernest Johnson returned Jason Myers's kick for 28 yards, and while New England advanced to Seattle's 49-yard line, they were ultimately forced to punt shortly after quarterback Drake Maye was sacked for a loss of 10 yards by Derick Hall and could not convert on third and 11. After two straight drives by each team ended with punts, Jason Myers kicked a 39-yard field goal after Seattle drove down the field with 30-yard and 29-yard runs by Kenneth Walker III, respectively. After three more drives ended with punts, Seattle added another field goal from 41 yards by Myers with 11 seconds left in the first half. The half ended following a kneel down by Maye to run out the clock.
Second half
In the third quarter, after the Patriots opened with a three-and-out, the Seahawks put together a 10-play, 69-yard drive that included a 20-yard pass to Walker and 16-yard passes to Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Rashid Shaheed, respectively; it ended with Myers kicking his fourth a field goal from 41 yards out to give the Seahawks a 12–0 lead. After four straight drives ended in punts, the Patriots fumbled after Maye was strip-sacked by Hall again, which was recovered by Byron Murphy II at the New England's 37-yard line. Following the turnover, the Seahawks converted on a third and 9 with a Darnold pass to Kupp as the fourth quarter began and Darnold threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Barner, extending Seattle's lead to 19–0. The Patriots' next drive was a 3-play, 65-yard drive that included a 24-yard pass and a 35-yard touchdown pass to Mack Hollins, cutting into Seattle's lead to 19–7. The Seahawks' next drive started with a 11-yard pass from Darnold to Shaheed, but ended with a punt by Michael Dickson that was downed at New England's 4-yard line by Velus Jones Jr. Maye began New England's next offensive drive which included a 13-yard pass to Rhamondre Stevenson and a 16-yard run by himself, but after throwing a 7-yard pass to rookie wide receiver Kyle Williams, he threw an interception to Seattle safety Julian Love, who returned it 35 yards to New England's 38-yard line. After Walker rushed for 24 yards on the next two plays, the Seahawks' offensive drive following the turnover ended on Myers scoring a record fifth field goal from 26 yards to increase Seattle's lead to 22–7. The Seahawks' defense responded with a sack by Murphy and ultimately a pick-six by linebacker Uchenna Nwosu after Devon Witherspoon pressured Maye on a cornerback blitz play, allowing Nwosu to return the ball 45 yards for a defensive touchdown. The Patriots finally responded with a Maye pass to running back Rhamondre Stevenson for a touchdown, however the corresponding two-point conversion pass to tight end Hunter Henry fell incomplete. An onside kick by New England was recovered by the Seahawks' George Holani, and a offensive holding penalty on Seattle center Jalen Sundell both nullified a Walker 49-yard touchdown run and pushed them back 10 yards, forcing them to punt just after the two-minute warning. The game ended with a 24-yard pass from Maye to running back TreVeyon Henderson, with the clock subsequently running out.
The Seattle defense was widely credited for their performance in a largely defensive game.
Kenneth Walker III was named Super Bowl MVP based on his 135 rushing yards on 27 carries.
