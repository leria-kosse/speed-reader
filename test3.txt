Behaviour and ecology
Clownfish are omnivorous, and mostly feed on planktonic food such as algae, copepods and larval tunicates. Algae makes up much of the diet of the pink skunk clownfish. Clownfish also feed on the waste discharged by the anemone. Feeding takes up most of a clownfish's daily activity. Where predators are less common, clownfish may forage in an area as large as 20 m2 (220 sq ft) around their anemone. Otherwise they are restricted to feeding in the water column above their host. The dominant pair in a clownfish group feed further from the anemone than the smaller subordinates.
Relationship with sea anemones
Clownfish have a mutualistic and symbiotic relationship with sea anemones. They acclimate themselves to their hosts by touching, nipping and fanning the tentacles over a period of minutes to days. The main benefit of living among anemones is protection from predators by anemone's stinging tentacles. A straying clownfish retreats to the safety of the tentacles when it encounters a potential threat, and it is always near its host, with smaller fish rarely leaving the oral disc. A clownfish may even swim into the coelenteron (gastrovascular cavity), though Allen observes this to be uncommon. Nighttime is spent resting deep among the tentacles. A less important benefit for clownfish is nourishment from the discharged waste and parasites.

Anemones are less dependent on clownfish than the fish are on them, as is evident as many individuals of host species lack clownfish. Nevertheless, clownfish contribute to the survival of their hosts by guarding from anemone-eating fish such as the raccoon butterflyfish. Other benefits they provide include the removal of copepod parasites, increased oxygen flow via the rapid movements of the fish's fins and the attraction of additional zooxanthellae by clownfish waste. A 2005 study found that anemones grew and regenerated faster in the presence of clownfish groups, and attributed this to ammonium from clownfish waste. Experimental evidence finds that when a clownfish is given small and large pieces of food, it consumes the former and give the latter to their anemone.
A total of ten sea anemone species are used by clownfish as hosts: the malu anemone, sebae anemone, magnificent sea anemone, corkscrew tentacle sea anemone, Mertens' carpet sea anemone, Haddon's sea anemone, giant carpet anemone, adhesive anemone, bubble-tip anemone, and beaded sea anemone. Some clownfishes are generalist in their choice of hosts, while others are more specialised. Clark's anemonefish is the most generalised species and utilises all ten anemone species, while nine clownfish species — the tomato clownfish, Chagos anemonefish, Pacific anemonefish, Seychelles anemonefish, Madagascar anemonefish, McCulloch's anemonefish, Maldive anemonefish, sebae clownfish, and maroon clownfish — use just one anemone species respectively. Desirable traits in a host include long tentacles to hide among. In addition, certain anemones like the beaded and bubble-tip sea anemone have tentacles with knob-like structures, which provide more surface area for the fish to conceal itself. The magnificent sea anemone can provide extra protection as clownfish can hide inside its soft body when it engulfs its tentacles. The potency of venom is also important; highly toxic anemone species tend to have smaller tentacles and so provide less shelter but more protection. Clownfish can cohabitate with other species on an anemone, including other clownfish, other fish such as the threespot dascyllus, and various decapods. Tolerance of the threespot dascyllus can vary between clownfish species.
The ability of clownfish to avoid being stung is attributed to their mucus coating. There is evidence that clownfish mucus mimics the molecules or bacteria of anemone mucus and lacks the trigger for the anemone's nematocysts (stinging barbs). Mucus thickness may also play a role, but the evidence is ambiguous. There is dispute over how much of the mucus is innate to the clownfish and how much is gained from the anemone during the acclimation period. This may vary between species. A 2019 study found evidence that clownfish exchange microbiota with their anemone hosts.
